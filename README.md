# Lehmer Random Number Generator

How if random number generator that we always use is actually not random?

Well, the truth is bitter but it is actually not totally random. One of examples for random number generator is Lehmer algorithm. It is a systematical method to generate the "random" number. In this project we may see why and how to prove its unrandomness.

Before further calculation, we should know what is the meaning of full-period and modulus compatible multipliers.

The attachment from "Discrete Event Simulation - A First Course - Lemmis Park" (page 51) should suffice for a brief overview.
